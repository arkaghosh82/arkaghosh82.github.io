                    <p>Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu
                        monk,
                        philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna
                        Paramhansa.He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and
                        the
                        father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and
                        bringing
                        Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.</p>
                    <p>After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of
                        lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu
                        philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco
                        (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for
                        Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which
                        provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission,
                        which provides charity, social work and education.</p>
                    <p>Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary
                        India, and the most successful missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major
                        force in contemporary Hindu reform movements and contributed to the concept of nationalism in
                        colonial India. He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential people of modern India
                        and
                        a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.</p>

                        In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan
                        Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after
                        his
                        family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the
                        Presidency
                        College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including
                        philosophy,
                        religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu
                        scriptures,
                        including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the
                        Puranas.
                        Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise,
                        sports
                        and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European
                        history at the
                        General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881, he passed
                        the Fine
                        Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.</p>
                    <p>William Hastie (principal of Christian College, Calcutta; from where Narendra graduated) wrote,
                        "Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad
                        of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He
                        is bound to make his mark in life"</p>
                    <p>Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Several incidents
                        have
                        been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from Pickwick
                        Papers.
                        Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference
                        to
                        some
                        details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In
                        another
                        incident with Dr. Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical
                        work
                        and
                        did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologised to Dr. Deussen explaining
                        that
                        he
                        was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with
                        this
                        explanation, but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text, leaving the professor
                        dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock
                        from
                        a
                        library and returned them the very next day, claiming that he had read them. The librarian
                        refused
                        to
                        believe him, until cross-examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was
                        indeed
                        being
                        truthful.</p>

                        In 1880, Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after
                        meeting
                        Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendra became a member of a
                        Freemasonry
                        lodge "at some point before 1884" and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway
                        faction
                        of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. From 1881 to 1884, he was
                        also
                        active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking
                        drinking. </p>
                    <p>It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. His
                        initial
                        beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which denounced polytheism and caste restrictions, and a
                        "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and
                        modernistic
                        reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta." Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who
                        was
                        strongly influenced by unitarianism, strove towards a universalistic interpretation of Hinduism.
                        His
                        ideas were "altered [...] considerably" by Debendranath Tagore, who had a romantic approach to
                        the
                        development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and
                        karma, and rejected the authority of the Vedas. Tagore also brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer
                        in
                        line with western esotericism, a development which was furthered by Sen. Sen was influenced by
                        transcendentalism, an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with
                        unitarianism, which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology.
                        Sen
                        strived to "an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality", introducing "lay
                        systems of spiritual practice" which can be regarded as an influence to the teachings
                        Vivekananda
                        later popularised in the west.</p>
                    <p>Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to "the question which marked the
                        real
                        beginning of his intellectual quest for God." He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if
                        they
                        had come "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time,
                        Narendra
                        met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of
                        answering his question, Tagore said, "My boy, you have the Yogi's eyes." According to Banhatti,
                        it
                        was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying "Yes, I see Him as I see you,

                    <p>
                        In 1881, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had
                        died in
                        1884. </p>
                    <p>Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's
                        Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The
                        Excursion. While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students
                        visit
                        Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his
                        students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.</p>

                    <p>In late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met
                        Ramakrishna.This
                        meeting proved to be a turning point in his life. Although he did not initially accept
                        Ramakrishna
                        as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to
                        frequently visit him at Dakshineswar. He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as
                        "mere
                        figments of imagination" and "hallucinations". As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol
                        worship,
                        polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of "identity
                        with
                        the absolute" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea. Narendra tested
                        Ramakrishna,
                        who faced his arguments patiently: "Try to see the truth from all angles", he replied.</p>
                    <p>One day, Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial
                        welfare.
                        Ramakrishna instead suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's
                        suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities
                        and
                        ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew
                        ready to
                        renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.</p>
                    <p>In 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a
                        garden
                        house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last
                        days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa
                        samadhi.
                        Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first
                        monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God.
                        Ramakrishna
                        asked him to care of the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as
                        their
                        leader. Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.</p>

                        In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering
                        monk,
                        "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go". His sole
                        possessions
                        were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The
                        Imitation of
                        Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and
                        acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy
                        for the
                        suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on
                        bhiksha
                        (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his
                        travels
                        he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas,
                        Hindus,
                        Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials. On 31 May 1893,
                        Narendra
                        left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, "Vivekananda"–a
                        conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning "the bliss of discerning wisdom".

                    <p>Vivekananda wanted to join The Parliament Of Religions, but was disappointed to learn that no one
                        without credentials from a bona fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate. Vivekananda
                        contacted
                        Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard.
                        Vivekananda
                        wrote of the professor, "He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions,
                        which
                        he thought would give an introduction to the nation".Hearing
                        Vivekananda
                        speak, Harvard psychology professor William James said, "that man is simply a wonder for
                        oratorical
                        power. He is an honor to humanity."</p>

                    <p>The Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of
                        Chicago,
                        as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech
                        representing India and Hinduism. He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess
                        of
                        learning) and began his speech with "Sisters and brothers of America!". At these words,
                        Vivekananda
                        received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand. Vivekananda quoted two
                        illustrative
                        passages from the "Shiva mahimna stotram": "As the different streams having their sources in
                        different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men
                        take,
                        through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to
                        Thee!"
                        and "Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through
                        paths that in the end lead to Me."According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, "it was only a short speech,
                        but
                        it voiced the spirit of the Parliament."</p>

                    <p>Bartaman Bharat meaning "Present Day India"[228] is an erudite Bengali language essay written by
                        him, which was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language
                        magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905
                        and later compiled into the fourth volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda.[229] [230]
                        In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every Indian as a brother
                        irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste</p>
                    <p>
                        Other than this he has written "Praccho Paschatyo", "Poribrajak" and some poems and Sanskrit
                        Stotrams. The "Khandana Bhava Bandhano" stotram of Ramakrishna Math and Mission is a work by
                        Swami Vivekananda. His works are included in "Complete Works Of Swami Vivekananda". His poems
                        are the condensed version of his intense eternal feelings.

                    <p>After Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples.[82] Unpaid
                    rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live.[83] Many
                    returned home, adopting a Grihastha (family-oriented) way of life.[84] Narendra decided to
                    convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math (monastery) for the remaining
                    disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by "holy begging" (mādhukarī). The math
                    became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of
                    Ramakrishna.[68] Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation
                    and religious austerities every day.[85] Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the
                    monastery: </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        "We underwent a lot of religious practice at the Baranagar Math. We used to get up at 3:00 am and
                        become absorbed in japa and meditation. What a strong spirit of detachment we had in those days!
                        We had no thought even as to whether the world existed or not."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, the monastic disciples formed the first Math (monastery) at Baranagore. Later, Vivekananda became a wandering monk, and in 1893, he was a delegate at the Parliament of the World's Religions held in the year 1893. His speech there, beginning with "Sisters and Brothers of America," became famous and brought him widespread recognition. Vivekananda went on lecture tours and held private discourses on Hinduism and spirituality. He also founded the first Vedanta Society in the United States, in New York. He returned to India in 1897 and founded the Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May 1897.[6] Though he was a Hindu sadhu and was hailed as the first Hindu missionary in modern times, he exhorted his followers to be true to their faith and respect all the religions of the world, as his guru Ramakrishna had taught that all religions are pathways to God. One such example is his exhortation that one can be born in a church, but he or she should not die in a church, meaning that one should realise the spiritual truths for themselves and not stop at blindly believing in doctrines taught to them. The same year, famine relief was started at Sargachi by Swami Akhandananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Swami Brahmananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, was appointed as the first president of the Order. After the death of Vivekananda in 1902, Sarada Devi, the spiritual counterpart of Ramakrishna, played an important role as the advisory head of a nascent monastic organisation. Gayatri Spivak writes that Sarada Devi "performed her role with tact and wisdom, always remaining in the background."

                    <p>Swami Vivekananda had a deep and profound love for India that inspired many others. He taught Indians to love and respect their country in order to overcome feelings of inferiority. Though he appreciated aspects of Western civilization, he believed India's spiritual traditions were more important and necessary for the world. Vivekananda was deeply saddened by India's suffering and would pray for better days. He became an embodiment of love for India and inspired all those around him to develop a love and appreciation for India, its culture and people.</p>
                    <p>Once someone told Swamiji that the monk should have no particularattachment to his country. Instead, he should view all countries as his own. At this,Swamiji replied : 'He who fails to love and support his mother how can he providesustenance for another's mother?' What Swamiji meant was that even the
                    sannyasins
                    should love their motherland. How can he who cannot love his owncountry, embrace the world? Patriotism first, then universalism</p>
                    <p>In the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal. In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, "The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India". Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually. Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers "who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition".</p>
                    <p>In his letters to Alasinga Perumal there is the written evidences of his love for this country. His intensely thought for his motherland and tried to throw out its sorrows. He said: For coming 50 years let your motherland be your only God, let other God take rest. Because he knew that without economic and political freedom no country can grow.</p>

                    <p>On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with Swami Premananda a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.</p>
